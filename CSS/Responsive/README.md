# Responsive Design Example

## This is a quick example of how you can create mobile first designs

### Usage:

1. Clone or pull from this repository
2. In your browser select the file menu and then open file OR (&#8984; + O)
3. Select 'responsiveDesign.html' in your finder

All of the responsive grid logic exists in the responsiveDesign.css file.

Try recreating this example using SASS / SCSS.

Its best practice to keep your SASS / SCSS grouped by functionality in [partials](http://sass-lang.com/guide). In this case the functionality that you will be recreating is a grid layout.
